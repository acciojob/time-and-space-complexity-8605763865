	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of how efficient an algorithm is in terms of time. It helps us understand the performance of an algorithm.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses. An algorithm with Space Complexity O(n) stores data using a linear amount of storage relative to the input size.
